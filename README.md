# Margin and Brokerage calculator

This app is developed by me because of my habbit of day trading in Zerodha.

This app solves my(and probably your's too) problem of frequently calculating margins for intraday stocks in zerodha platform and saves my most valuable trading time and i hope it saves your valuable time too.

Margin and Brokerage calculator is built with the goal of cutting down the time taken by us(The Trader's) to calculate margins and Brokerage for various types of stocks and commodities.

Now, with this application never miss the right opportunity to buy the stock you needed to buy at the right time because now you can redefine the way you trade.

This is achieved by adding the feature of bookmarking your favorite stock if you trade it on a regular basis and un-bookmark it when it is no longer needed.

This app supports the following margins
• Equity
• Commodity
• Futures
• Currency

This app also comes with the brokerage calculator for
• Equity F&O
• Commodity
• Currency

Integrating so many features into a single app comes at a risk of not so great UX but this app proves that fact wrong by giving top priority to design in conjunction with the powerful features.

So now we the traders need not open the browser again for brokerage or margins or waste time typing the name of the stock to calculate margin.

Use this app to calculate margins of your trade for one day and see the difference it makes.

# Things learnt the hard way from this project

1.Keep the activities and fragments as lean as possible

2.Use Helper classes if there is a task that you are repeatedly doing

3.Designing layouts is a complete mess if you dont have the design ready

4.never try to design layouts without a predesigned layout either on adobe xd or paper



Happy Trading :)
